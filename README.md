# Charity Tracker

## Description
This application allows a user to save charities to a database and add/update contact information and best ways to help. The app was specifically designed with businesses in mind, ideally with one employee or department (the "Admin") contacting charities with which the company would like to partner and establishing a working relationship. The app would then allow all company employees to view the list of partnered charities, and decide from there if they would like to donate, volunteer, etc.

Future instances of the app would provide a calender of events through which employees could sign up to attend, buy a table, or volunteer. There would also be a method to donate directly to any charity from the app, with contributions being automatically matched if the company donation matches with that specific organization.

User Story
As a company dedicated to partnering with charities
I want an app that allows me to search for and save charities into a database
So that my employees can more readily find, connect with, and contribute to charities
